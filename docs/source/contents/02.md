## What is Uplift Modeling?


Uplift Modeling is a Machine Learning technique to find which customers (individuals) should be
targeted ("treated") and which customers should not be targeted.

Uplift Modeling is also known as persuasion modeling, incremental modeling, treatment effects
modeling, true lift modeling, or net modeling.

Applications of Uplift Modeling for business include:
- Increase revenue by finding which customers should be targeted for advertising/marketing
campaigns and which customers should not.
- Retain revenue by finding which customers should be contacted to prevent churn and which
customers should not.
