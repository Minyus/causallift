## How to run inference (prediction of CATE for new data with `Treatment` and `Outcome` unknown)?

Use the whole historical data (A/B Test data or observational data) as train_df instead of splitting into `tran_df` and `test_df`, and use the new data with `Treatment` and `Outcome` unknown as `test_df`.

This is possible because `Treatment` and `Outcome` are not used for prediction of CATE after Uplift Model is trained using `Treatment` and `Outcome`.

Please note that valid evaluation for `test_df` will not be available as valid `Treatment` and `Outcome` are not available.
