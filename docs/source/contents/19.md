## Contributing

Any feedback is welcome!

Please create an issue for questions, suggestions, and feature requests.
Please open pull requests to improve documentation, usability, and features against `develop` branch.

Separate pull requests for each improvement are appreciated rather than a big pull request.
It is encouraged to use:
- [Google-style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
- [PEP 484 comment-style type annotation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet.html)
although Python 2 is not supported.
- An intelligent IDE such as PyCharm or VS Code

If you could write a review about CausalLift in any natural languages (English, Chinese, Japanese,
etc.) or implement similar features in any programming languages (R, SAS, etc.), please let me
know. I will add the link here.
