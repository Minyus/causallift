## Introduction

If you are simply building a Machine Learning model and executing promotion campaigns to the
customers who are predicted to buy a product, for example, it is not efficient.

Some customers will buy a product anyway even without promotion campaigns (called
"Sure things").

It is even possible that the campaign triggers some customers to churn (called "Do Not Disturbs" or
"Sleeping Dogs").

The solution is Uplift Modeling.
