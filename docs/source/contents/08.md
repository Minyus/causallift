## How is the data pipeline implemented by CausalLift?

### Step 0: Prepare data

Prepare the following columns in 2 pandas DataFrames, train and test (validation).

- Features
	- a.k.a independent variables, explanatory variables, covariates
	- e.g. customer gender, age range, etc.
	- Note: Categorical variables need to be one-hot coded so propensity can be estimated using
	logistic regression. [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) can be used.
- Outcome: binary (0 or 1)
	- a.k.a dependent variable, target variable, label
	- e.g. whether the customer bought a product, clicked a link, etc.
- Treatment: binary (0 or 1)
	- a variable you can control and want to optimize for each individual (customer)
	- a.k.a intervention
	- e.g. whether an advertising campaign was executed, whether a discount was offered, etc.
	- Note: if you cannot find a treatment column, you may need to ask stakeholders to get the data, which might take hours to years.
- [Optional] Propensity: continuous between 0 and 1
	- propensity (or probability) to be treated for observational datasets (not needed for A/B Testing results)
	- If not provided, CausalLift can estimate from the features using logistic regression.

### Step 1: Prepare for Uplift modeling and optionally estimate propensity scores using a supervised classification model

If the `train_df` is from observational data (not A/B Test), you can set `enable_ipw`=True so IPW (Inverse Probability Weighting) can address the issue that treatment should have been chosen based on a different probability (propensity score) for each individual (e.g. customer, patient, etc.)

If the `train_df` is from A/B Test or RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial), set `enble_ipw`=False to skip estimating propensity score.

### Step 2: Estimate CATE by 2 supervised classification models

Train 2 supervised classification models (e.g. XGBoost) for treated and untreated samples independently and compute estimated CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect), ITE (Individual Treatment Effect), or uplift score.

This step is the Uplift Modeling consisting of 2 sub-steps:

1. Training using train_df (Note: `Treatment` and `Outcome` are used)

2. Prediction of CATE for train_df and test_df (Note: Neither `Treatment` nor `Outcome` is used.)

### Step 3 [Optional] Estimate impact by following recommendation based on CATE

Estimate how much conversion rate will increase by selecting treatment (campaign) targets as recommended by the uplift modeling.

You can optionally evaluate the predicted CATE for train_df and test_df (Note: `CATE`, `Treatment` and `Outcome` are used.)

This step is _optional_; you can skip if you want only CATE and you do not find this evaluation step useful.
