## Why CausalLift was developed?

In a word, to use for real-world business.

- Existing packages for Uplift Modeling assumes the dataset is from A/B Testing (a.k.a. Randomized
Controlled Trial). In real-world business, however, observational datasets in which treatment
(campaign) targets were not chosen randomly are more common especially in the early stage of
evidence-based decision making. CausalLift supports observational datasets using a basic
methodology in Causal Inference called "Inverse Probability Weighting" based on the assumption that
propensity to be treated can be inferred from the available features.

- There are 2 challenges of Uplift Modeling; explainability of the model and evaluation. CausalLift
utilizes a basic methodology of Uplift Modeling called Two Models approach (training 2 models
independently for treated and untreated samples to compute the CATE (Conditional Average Treatment
Effects) or uplift scores) to address these challenges.

	- [Explainability of the model] Since it is relatively simple, it is less challenging to
	explain how it works to stakeholders in the business.

	- [Explainability of evaluation] To evaluate Uplift Modeling, metrics such as Qini and AUUC
	(Area Under the Uplift Curve) are used in research, but these metrics are difficult to explain
	to the stakeholders. For business, a metric that can estimate how much more profit can be
	earned is more practical. Since CausalLift adopted the Two-Model approach, the 2 models can be
	reused to simulate the outcome of following the recommendation by the Uplift Model and can
	estimate how much conversion rate (the proportion of people who took the desired action such as
	buying a product) will increase using the uplift model.
