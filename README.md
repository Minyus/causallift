## Introduction

If you are simply building a Machine Learning model and executing promotion campaigns to the
customers who are predicted to buy a product, for example, it is not efficient.

Some customers will buy a product anyway even without promotion campaigns (called
"Sure things").

It is even possible that the campaign triggers some customers to churn (called "Do Not Disturbs" or
"Sleeping Dogs").

The solution is Uplift Modeling.

## What is Uplift Modeling?


Uplift Modeling is a Machine Learning technique to find which customers (individuals) should be
targeted ("treated") and which customers should not be targeted.

Uplift Modeling is also known as persuasion modeling, incremental modeling, treatment effects
modeling, true lift modeling, or net modeling.

Applications of Uplift Modeling for business include:
- Increase revenue by finding which customers should be targeted for advertising/marketing
campaigns and which customers should not.
- Retain revenue by finding which customers should be contacted to prevent churn and which
customers should not.


## A famous use case?

The most famous use case of Uplift Modeling would be the 44th US president Barack Obama's 2nd
presidential campaign in 2012. Obama's team used Uplift Modeling to find which voters could be
persuaded to vote for him. Here are some articles.

- <[What is 'Persuasion Modeling', and how did it help Obama to win the elections?](http://numrush.com/2013/06/28/what-is-persuasion-modeling-and-how-did-it-help-obama-to-win-the-elections/)>

## How does Uplift Modeling work?

Uplift Modeling estimates uplift scores (a.k.a. CATE: Conditional Average Treatment Effect or ITE:
Individual Treatment Effect). Uplift score is how much the estimated conversion rate will increase
by the campaign.

Suppose you are in charge of a marketing campaign to sell a product, and the estimated conversion
rate (probability to buy a product) of a customer is 50 % if targeted and the estimated conversion
rate is 40 % if not targeted, then the uplift score of the customer is (50-40) = +10 % points.
Likewise, suppose the estimated conversion rate if targeted is 20 % and the estimated conversion
rate if not targeted is 80%, the uplift score is (20-80) = -60 % points (negative value).

The range of uplift scores is between -100 and +100 % points (-1 and +1).
It is recommended to target customers with high uplift scores and avoid customers with negative
uplift scores to optimize the marketing campaign.


## What are the advantages of "CausalLift" package?

- CausalLift works with both A/B testing results and observational datasets.
- CausalLift can output intuitive metrics for evaluation.

## Why CausalLift was developed?

In a word, to use for real-world business.

- Existing packages for Uplift Modeling assumes the dataset is from A/B Testing (a.k.a. Randomized
Controlled Trial). In real-world business, however, observational datasets in which treatment
(campaign) targets were not chosen randomly are more common especially in the early stage of
evidence-based decision making. CausalLift supports observational datasets using a basic
methodology in Causal Inference called "Inverse Probability Weighting" based on the assumption that
propensity to be treated can be inferred from the available features.

- There are 2 challenges of Uplift Modeling; explainability of the model and evaluation. CausalLift
utilizes a basic methodology of Uplift Modeling called Two Models approach (training 2 models
independently for treated and untreated samples to compute the CATE (Conditional Average Treatment
Effects) or uplift scores) to address these challenges.

	- [Explainability of the model] Since it is relatively simple, it is less challenging to
	explain how it works to stakeholders in the business.

	- [Explainability of evaluation] To evaluate Uplift Modeling, metrics such as Qini and AUUC
	(Area Under the Uplift Curve) are used in research, but these metrics are difficult to explain
	to the stakeholders. For business, a metric that can estimate how much more profit can be
	earned is more practical. Since CausalLift adopted the Two-Model approach, the 2 models can be
	reused to simulate the outcome of following the recommendation by the Uplift Model and can
	estimate how much conversion rate (the proportion of people who took the desired action such as
	buying a product) will increase using the uplift model.

## How is the data pipeline implemented by CausalLift?

### Step 0: Prepare data

Prepare the following columns in 2 pandas DataFrames, train and test (validation).

- Features
	- a.k.a independent variables, explanatory variables, covariates
	- e.g. customer gender, age range, etc.
	- Note: Categorical variables need to be one-hot coded so propensity can be estimated using
	logistic regression. [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) can be used.
- Outcome: binary (0 or 1)
	- a.k.a dependent variable, target variable, label
	- e.g. whether the customer bought a product, clicked a link, etc.
- Treatment: binary (0 or 1)
	- a variable you can control and want to optimize for each individual (customer)
	- a.k.a intervention
	- e.g. whether an advertising campaign was executed, whether a discount was offered, etc.
	- Note: if you cannot find a treatment column, you may need to ask stakeholders to get the data, which might take hours to years.
- [Optional] Propensity: continuous between 0 and 1
	- propensity (or probability) to be treated for observational datasets (not needed for A/B Testing results)
	- If not provided, CausalLift can estimate from the features using logistic regression.

<p align="center">
	Example table data
</p>

### Step 1: Prepare for Uplift modeling and optionally estimate propensity scores using a supervised classification model

If the `train_df` is from observational data (not A/B Test), you can set `enable_ipw`=True so IPW (Inverse Probability Weighting) can address the issue that treatment should have been chosen based on a different probability (propensity score) for each individual (e.g. customer, patient, etc.)

If the `train_df` is from A/B Test or RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial), set `enble_ipw`=False to skip estimating propensity score.

### Step 2: Estimate CATE by 2 supervised classification models

Train 2 supervised classification models (e.g. XGBoost) for treated and untreated samples independently and compute estimated CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect), ITE (Individual Treatment Effect), or uplift score.

This step is the Uplift Modeling consisting of 2 sub-steps:

1. Training using train_df (Note: `Treatment` and `Outcome` are used)

2. Prediction of CATE for train_df and test_df (Note: Neither `Treatment` nor `Outcome` is used.)

### Step 3 [Optional] Estimate impact by following recommendation based on CATE

Estimate how much conversion rate will increase by selecting treatment (campaign) targets as recommended by the uplift modeling.

You can optionally evaluate the predicted CATE for train_df and test_df (Note: `CATE`, `Treatment` and `Outcome` are used.)

This step is _optional_; you can skip if you want only CATE and you do not find this evaluation step useful.


## How to use CausalLift?

There are 2 ways:
  - [Deprecated option] Use `causallift.CausalLift` class interface
  - [Recommended option] Use `causallift.nodes` subpackage with [`PipelineX`](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex) package

### [Deprecated option] Use `causallift.CausalLift` class interface

Please see the demo code in Google Colab (free cloud CPU/GPU environment):

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/Minyus/causallift/blob/master/notebooks/demo/CausalLift_demo.ipynb
)

To run the code, navigate to "Runtime" >> "Run all".

To download the notebook file, navigate to "File" >> "Download .ipynb".

Here are the basic steps to use.

```python
from causallift import CausalLift

""" Step 1. """
cl = CausalLift(train_df, test_df, enable_ipw=True)

""" Step 2. """
train_df, test_df = cl.estimate_cate_by_2_models()

""" Step 3. """
estimated_effect_df = cl.estimate_recommendation_impact()
```


### [Recommended option] Use `causallift.nodes` subpackage with [`PipelineX`](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex) package

Please see [PipelineX](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex) package and
 use [PipelineX Causallift example project](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex_causallift).


## How to run inference (prediction of CATE for new data with `Treatment` and `Outcome` unknown)?

Use the whole historical data (A/B Test data or observational data) as train_df instead of splitting into `tran_df` and `test_df`, and use the new data with `Treatment` and `Outcome` unknown as `test_df`.

This is possible because `Treatment` and `Outcome` are not used for prediction of CATE after Uplift Model is trained using `Treatment` and `Outcome`.

Please note that valid evaluation for `test_df` will not be available as valid `Treatment` and `Outcome` are not available.
